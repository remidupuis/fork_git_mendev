Le joueur à droite pioche une carte, the movements of the player before her have stimulated strongly her memories, 
beliefs and emotional wounds. Her freedom, or impression of freedom is put to a test. 
The card she takes is to « not let be », whatever will be, she will oppose to it. Thoughts like « is not fair » will constantly appear. 
The calm went, the welcoming state leaves her, discomfort raises, nothing to thank anymore.
