In the land of criticism, everything is allowed. The game’s attraction is so strong, the participants are used to play it for years or entire lifes. 
The dices are thrown, the game starts. One player takes a card, past memories are remembered, the action is to play with a closed heart, 
no trust, only what is « mine » is important, the rest can go, can disappear, the action is to move in life giving orders to others, 
with a closed heart and an even more closed mind. No place to listening or caring about others, 
just imposing others what the player thinks is correct… next player’s turn.
