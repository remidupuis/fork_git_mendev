In the land of criticism, everything is allowed. The game’s attraction is so strong, the participants are used to play it for years or entire lifes.
This is a line added by Remi. 
The game is played with a closed heart, no trust, only what is « mine » is important, the rest can go, can disappear, the action is to move in life giving orders to others.
The game is played with a closed mind, no place to listening or caring about others, just imposing others what the player thinks is correct.
The dices are thrown, the game starts. One player takes a card, past memories are remembered, the action is to play with a closed heart, 
no trust, only what is « mine » is important, the rest can go, can disappear, the action is to move in life giving orders to others, 
with a closed heart and an even more closed mind. No place to listening or caring about others, 
just imposing others what the player thinks is correct… next player’s turn.
