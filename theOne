The One observes the game played by persons in a role. Consciousness is there, accompanying each movement. 
Silence and water supports the Self to reveal and to leave the focus on the game. 
Thank you marvelous life for the calm sleep and wake up time. For the beautiful sky and the autumn sights, simplicity is around. 
Movements are in action: cooking and cleaning. Let life be, stand aside of it. 
Take action with an open heart, without a card to be played. Just breath and open your senses. 
In the middle of the noise and the movements maybe Freedom can find me. No expectations just be.
Nothing to be said. Keep an open heart. Welcoming the players, addicted to their game. 
The Consciousness is next to them, their path is as it has to be. Can yo feel the stillness in the middle of activity? 
Can you breath the Trust? Away from the discomfort or body’s pains, away from the person’s wounds and beliefs, 
away from the feeling of « unfair », away from the need to give lessons to others. 
Just interior silence, supported by the Universe. Nobody has the power to interrupt that. 
Calm and joy, wordless, action-less, no problem to be solved.

Yo, this is cool yo !
